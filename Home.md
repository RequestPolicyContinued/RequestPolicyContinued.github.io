#### What are cross-site requests?

**Cross-site requests** are requests that your browser is told to make by a website you are visiting to a completely different website.

#### ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/media/flag.png) What does RequestPolicy Continued do?

RequestPolicy Continued allows you to block all cross-site requests, and only allow specific ones (**whitelisting**), either manually, or by subscribing to premade policies ([subscriptions](#Setting-up---subscriptions)) maintained by others. For easier usage, you can also keep allowing cross-site requests, but block some by manually **blacklisting** them, or by subscribing to blacklists maintained by others.

#### ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/media/privacy.png) Privacy

While some cross-site requests are required for websites to work properly, they often result in [advertising networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising_network) and other websites **knowing your browsing habits, including specific pages you view** throughout the day.

#### ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/media/security.png) Security

Cross-site requests are **also used in attacks** on users who are browsing the web. RequestPolicy Continued helps defending against dangerous attacks like Clickjacking and _Cross-Site Request Forgery_ (CSRF), where your browser is told to make a request to another website and that other website thinks you (the person) meant to make the request.

#### ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/media/about.png) About RequestPolicyContinued
RequestPolicy Continued is a continuation of the [original project](https://requestpolicy.com/) from [Justin Samuel](https://github.com/jsamuel) by volunteers. It is based on the 1.0 beta version of RequestPolicy, which is a major rewrite and refactoring of the [0.5 version still available on Addons for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/requestpolicy-continued/). Currently we aim at releasing our first stable version – 1.0 – but there is still much to do. If you want to be informed about this milestone, you could subscribe to [this issue](https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/issues/446). If you're interested, you can find a list of all open issues for version 1.0 [here](https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/milestones/1.0).

_![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/media/warning.png) There are still some [compatibility issues](https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%221.0+vs+0.5%22) when upgrading from the older 0.5 version. You can downgrade at any time though. A Firefox 38+ compatible version of RequestPolicy 0.5 is [available at addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/requestpolicy-continued/)_
