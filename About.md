## RequestPolicy continued

RequestPolicy Continued is a continuation of the original project by volunteers. This friendly fork of the original project is maintained by the [community](https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/graphs/contributors) at Github.

The original RequestPolicy was discontinued in 2012 by the author and work resumed in 2014 to bring bug fixes and enhancements to the addon. This work is based on the 1.0 version of RequestPolicy.

## Beta releases

Beta releases for testers and developers are available on the project's releases page. You can also [build the addon from the latest code revision](dev#getting-the-source-code).
