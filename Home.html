<h4 id="what-are-cross-site-requests">What are cross-site requests?</h4>
<p><strong>Cross-site requests</strong> are requests that your browser is told to make by a website you are visiting to a completely different website.</p>
<h4 id="what-does-requestpolicy-continued-do"><img src="media/flag.png" /> What does RequestPolicy Continued do?</h4>
<p>RequestPolicy Continued allows you to block all cross-site requests, and only allow specific ones (<strong>whitelisting</strong>), either manually, or by subscribing to premade policies (<a href="#Setting-up---subscriptions">subscriptions</a>) maintained by others. For easier usage, you can also keep allowing cross-site requests, but block some by manually <strong>blacklisting</strong> them, or by subscribing to blacklists maintained by others.</p>

<h4 id="privacy"><img src="media/privacy.png" /> Privacy</h4>
<p>While some cross-site requests are required for websites to work properly, they often result in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising_network">advertising networks</a> and other websites <strong>knowing your browsing habits, including specific pages you view</strong> throughout the day. <a href="Privacy.html">Learn more about privacy...</a></p>
<hr />
<h4 id="security"><img src="media/security.png" /> Security</h4>
<p>Cross-site requests are <strong>also used in attacks</strong> on users who are browsing the web. RequestPolicy Continued helps defending against dangerous attacks like Clickjacking and <em>Cross-Site Request Forgery</em> (CSRF), where your browser is told to make a request to another website and that other website thinks you (the person) meant to make the request. <a href="Security.html">Learn more about security...</a></p>

<p>RequestPolicy Continued is a continuation of the <a href="https://requestpolicy.com/">original project</a> from <a href="https://github.com/jsamuel">Justin Samuel</a> by volunteers. It is based on the 1.0 beta version of RequestPolicy, which is a major rewrite and refactoring of the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/requestpolicy-continued/">0.5 version still available on Addons for Firefox</a>. Currently we aim at releasing our first stable version – 1.0 – but there is still much to do. If you want to be informed about this milestone, you could subscribe to <a href="https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/issues/446">this issue</a>. If you're interested, you can find a list of all open issues for version 1.0 <a href="https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/milestones/1.0">here</a>.</p>
<p><em><img src="media/warning.png" /> There are still some <a href="https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%221.0+vs+0.5%22">compatibility issues</a> when upgrading from the older 0.5 version. You can downgrade at any time though. A Firefox 38+ compatible version of RequestPolicy 0.5 is <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/requestpolicy-continued/">available at addons.mozilla.org</a></em></p>
