<p>Here are a few ways you can help make this project better!</p>
<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<p>If you have any questions or general thoughts about the project, please post them in our <a href="https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/issues/484">general discussion</a></p>
<h3 id="testing-reporting-bugs-requesting-new-features">Testing, reporting bugs &amp; requesting new features</h3>
<p>Always use the <a href="https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/releases/">latest release</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy#getting-the-source-code">build the XPI from the most recent source revision</a></p>
<p>If you'd like a bug to be fixed or a feature added, <a href="https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/issues">find if it has already been reported</a>. Open a new issue if needed, and add information about the bug/request such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steps to reproduce the bug (user actions)</li>
<li>What should happen.</li>
<li>What happens instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Response time from the maintainers should be around a few days.</p>
<p><strong>Please bear in mind that each user might have a different browser setup. Sometimes it's necessary to further investigate the problem:</strong></p>
<p>Some bugs are caused by other Firefox addons interfering with RequestPolicy. To make sure a bug is caused by RequestPolicy itself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable all other addons from Firefox's addon manager</li>
<li>Try to reproduce the bug</li>
</ul>
<p>If the bug does <em>not</em> happen with only RPC enabled, the bug is related to another addon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Re-enable one addon, test again.</li>
<li>Repeat until the problem occurs again</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/issues">Report us</a> the incompatible addon (with a link to the addon download page)</li>
</ul>
<p>To test if the bug is related to your specific configuration, you can <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles">create a new, blank Firefox profile</a> and try to reproduce the bug.</p>
