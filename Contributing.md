## Contributing

Here are a few ways you can help make this project better!

### Discussion
If you have any questions or general thoughts about the project, please post them in our [general discussion](https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/issues/484)


### Testing, reporting bugs & requesting new features

Always use the [latest release](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/requestpolicy-continued/versions/beta), or [build the XPI from the most recent source revision](https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy#getting-the-source-code)

If you'd like a bug to be fixed or a feature added, [find if it has already been reported](https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/issues). Open a new issue if needed, and add information about the bug/request such as:

 * Steps to reproduce the bug (user actions)
 * What should happen.
 * What happens instead.

Response time from the maintainers should be around a few days.

**Please bear in mind that each user might have a different browser setup. Sometimes it's necessary to further investigate the problem:**

Some bugs are caused by other Firefox addons interfering with RequestPolicy. To make sure a bug is caused by RequestPolicy itself:

 * Disable all other addons from Firefox's addon manager
 * Try to reproduce the bug

If the bug does _not_ happen with only RPC enabled, the bug is related to another addon:

 * Re-enable one addon, test again.
 * Repeat until the problem occurs again
 * [Report us](https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/issues) the incompatible addon (with a link to the addon download page)

To test if the bug is related to your specific configuration, you can [create a new, blank Firefox profile](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles) and try to reproduce the bug.

You can ask the maintainers to close already fixed bugs by testing old tickets to see if they are happening, or remove duplicate bug reports.
